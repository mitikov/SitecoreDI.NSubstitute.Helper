# SitecoreDI.NSubstitute.Helper
The reason for this project is to just show some hints to developers for how they can substitute some Sitecore classes.
If one build the project using build scripts he will be able to refernce the nuget package with helper utils for usage in own project.

**Note**: the package doe not reference Sitecore API nuget package so that it does not require Sitecore infrastructure. Please add references to Sitecore.Kernel file manually.
